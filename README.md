# What's on TVite?
Focusing on learning Vite getting more into Typescript and some more practise manipulating data.

TVite - "Your one stop shop for all your favourite coding shows" 

Our chanllange was to compleete this website. 
The starting repo we cloned off's website only useed placeholder schedule data.
We needed to establish library functions to load the real data, display it and return the site to its former useful state!

Using NPM we're preasticing TTD and making sure our tests work as we go.

## Requirements

### 1. Getting started

Let's get familiar with the code base so you can begin to understand what needs to be done to get it to work.

- [ ] Firstly, have a look through the code. What is the *shape* of the data in `schedule.ts` and how does this compare to `models/show.ts`?

  <table>
  <tr>
  <th>schedule.ts</th>
  <th>models/show.ts</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
  <td>
    
  ```ts
  export default [
    {
      time: '08:00 AM',
      name: 'Codebusters Morning Mystery',
      description: 'Join the gang for coding challenges with a Scooby twist.',
    },
    ...
  ]
  ```
    
  </td>
  <td>

  ```ts
  export interface Show {
    time: string
    name: string
    description: string
  }
  ```

  </td>
  </tr>
  </table>

  <details>
  <summary>More about interfaces</summary>

    - Notice how the `Show` interface is located in `Models/show.ts`? In general models are a software representation of a real world subject or thing. In typescript, they can be defined as an [interface](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/objects.html). We will be keeping useful models in the models directory of our projects from now on.

    - Here `Show` is declared as interface or object type that can be reused throughout the program.  In this case, `Show` has all the properties needed to represent a TV show on our website. All we have to do is import it where we need it!
    
    - We capitalise the name to make a distinction between it as a type and other regular variables we might be using.
  </details>


- [ ] What other important files can you spot, and what are they for? The `lib.ts` file for example contains the functions you will need, but at this stage they only return placeholders. Look at each of the comments describing how each function works. 

- [ ] If you have the development server running `npm run dev`, you can visit our site at http://localhost:5173. You'll see that a lot of the functionality shows placeholder data. 

- [ ] Notice how there are tests to test the different functions in the lib file. Run our tests with `npm test`, you'll see that initially none of them are passing.

- [ ] Now that you have an idea of what is going on, let's get our lib file set up. Import the schedule and type so that we can access the data later. 
  ```ts
  import schedule from './schedule.ts'

  import {Show} from './models/show.ts'
  ```

### 2. Working on helper Functions

#### `getTime`

- [ ] Let's start with the `getTime` function. This function will be a helper function for later. Consider the `show` parameter and its type, `Show`. What will the function need to return? Hover over the `Show` parameter type to see its structure.

- [ ] Complete the current implementation so that it returns a time for any show. Provide a meaningful TypeScript return type for the function.

  ```typescript
  export function getTime(show: Show): string {
    return show.time
  }
  ```
  Here we define a return type of `string` for the function because `show.time` is a string.

- [ ] Run the tests with npm test after completing the getTime function to verify if it passes.

#### `getName`

- [ ] Repeat the same steps above for the `getName` function.

### 3. Working with data from the data file

- [ ] `schedule.ts` is the data file for this project. It contains all of the data for the various TV shows, including their airing times, names and descriptions. In this case, `schedule.ts` contains an exported array Shows.

- [ ] To load the data, we imported `schedule.ts` at the top of the `lib.ts` file and stored it in a variable called `schedule`. Use the schedule variable to complete the `getShowTime` function.

- [ ] Run the tests to verify if it passes. Have a look at the website develop step by step as you complete the function too!

- [ ] Complete remaining functions in lib.ts up until the section named Stretch.

- [ ] Consider where you may be able to refactor your code re-use functions e.g. your `getTime` and `getName` functions.

### Hints

<details>
  <summary>Hints for each of the functions</summary>

  1. `getName` is similar to `getTime`. What should it return?
  2. For `getShowTimes` and `getShowNames`, consider using a [`.map()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map). Don't forget to give appropriate types if needed. Bonus points for reusing your getTime and getName functions from earlier!
  3. `getShowByTimeslot` receives a timeslot string as a parameter. use [`.find()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/find) to locate the correct show within the schedule array.

</details>

### Stretch
- [ ] Complete the `getNextShowByTimeslot` function.

  <details>
  <summary>Hint:</summary>

  - `getNextShowByTimeslot` needs a way to access an index in the array and some conditional logic. Look into [`.findIndex()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/findIndex) and consider how to make use of the result.
